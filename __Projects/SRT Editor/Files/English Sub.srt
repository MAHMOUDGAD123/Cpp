1
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,500
From time immemorial,

2
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,580
the ancient Ukrainian forest

3
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,920
has harboured amazing secrets
and mysteries.

4
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,750
Behind the Dark Mountain,

5
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,390
in the forest's heart,

6
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,680
the Source of Life is hidden.

7
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,050
It provides the forest
and its dwellers

8
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,890
with their power, their spark.

9
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,440
But one winter,

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,310
while the forest
was fast asleep,

11
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,940
with the guardian alone
watching over it,

12
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,230
a human broke into the forest

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,530
through the passage
in the Dark Mountain.

14
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,360
It was the owner of the sawmill.

15
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,570
He needed at least one drop
from the Source of Life

16
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,620
to save his dying
newborn daughter.

17
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,040
But then he returned
and brought an army with him,

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,620
hoping to take over
the entire Source for himself.

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,010
And so a terrible battle began

20
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,630
that left no winners.

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,930
Only losers.

22
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,470
All humans who had trespassed

23
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,350
behind the Dark Mountain
vanished.

24
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,390
The Forest Guardian

25
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,640
lost all but an echo
of his ancient strength.

26
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,560
And when the forest creatures
woke in the spring,

27
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,950
they were greeted by
the horrific consequences

28
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,820
of the humans' treachery.

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,240
Look at what
our enemies have done.

30
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,290
For this reason,

31
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,210
no human shall set foot

32
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,870
behind the Dark Mountain
ever again!

33
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,130
This is the new forest law.

34
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,380
Many years have passed
since that day.

35
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,950
Another winter is over.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,950
Oh, I've slept so long.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,950
I was having
the loveliest dream.

38
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,920
But this is better
than any dream.

39
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,440
It's finally spring.

40
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,680
Swampy!

41
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,720
It's the best part
of the best day of the year.

42
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,180
Time to wake up the forest.

43
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,970
Hark! Hush, the master
of sounds, approaches.

44
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,190
Happy spring, Mavka!

45
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,980
Hush! You can fly?!

46
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,600
That's kind of huge news.

47
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,810
They'll call me Hush,
who conquered the sky!

48
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,570
Just don't tell Lesh.

49
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,160
He'll think
I'm stork-raving mad.

50
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,920
Whoa!

51
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,600
Yeah! One more! More!

52
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,730
And the fans go wild!

53
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,680
We are so ready
to conquer the world.

54
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,740
Settle down, kid.
Hometown crowd.

55
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,490
Everybody knows us here.

56
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,820
Wow, I'm just so nervous.

57
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,610
What if things don't work out
in the city?

58
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,530
There are so many
other musicians there.

59
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,620
You have to believe
in yourself, Nina,

60
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,620
and let the music
show us the way.

61
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,540
Whatever that's
supposed to mean.

62
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,670
What was that?

63
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,810
"Big money
for an important job?"

64
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,100
Hm, not for a soon-to-be
musical legend like me.

65
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,310
But maybe Uncle Leo
can use this.

66
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,770
Lucas, your uncle,

67
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,610
he's not feeling well.

68
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,610
They called the healer
and everything.

69
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,610
Get home, quick.

70
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,400
Hopefully we'll see you
at the fair later.

71
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,700
-Hey, look!
-What is it?

72
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,430
Greetings,

73
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,890
after so long,
my dear fellow villagers.

74
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,060
It is I, Kylina,

75
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,470
the daughter and only heiress
of the late sawmill owner.

76
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,110
The one that got burned up
by forest demons?

77
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,320
Yes, my father died tragically

78
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,730
in a forest wildfire,

79
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,450
but it had nothing to do
with your quaint superstitions.

80
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,330
After dear Daddy's death,
my mother and I left this place,

81
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,620
but soon I became an orphan.

82
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,540
-Oh, poor thing. What a shame.

83
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,790
How positively tragic!

84
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,420
But now I am back to make
our village prosperous again.

85
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,300
I'm offering you all a job.

86
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,050
You'll have so much money

87
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,510
that you'll never
have to work again.

88
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,600
Not working is my dream job.

89
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,060
I'll rebuild the sawmill.

90
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,520
We'll start selling our timber
all around the world.

91
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,900
Aren't you all good and ready
to become rich and happy?

92
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,990
-Yeah!
-Absolutely.

93
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,910
-Yes!
-What do you want us to do?

94
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,870
All you have to do is pop over
the Dark Mountain...

95
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,240
What?

96
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,030
Oh, she's cuckoo.

97
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,580
Ugh, just like her father.

98
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,380
But I'm talking huge money.

99
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,790
You can't buy another life.

100
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,210
Tell the evil spirits I said hi.

101
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,550
-What's that?

102
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,740
Easy, easy.

103
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,250
What's the matter?

104
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,540
A trap!

105
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,420
Probably left
from the old times.

106
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,010
Huh?

107
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,400
Huh?

108
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,710
The guardian is calling us.

109
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,910
Uh, how is he?

110
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,120
He's holding on, but my herbs
can only do so much.

111
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:56,420
Leo needs real medicine
from the city.

112
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,380
But...it's not going
to be cheap.

113
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,770
Uh...

114
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,890
"Per-du-cabri-co-carum"?

115
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,020
Just give this to the pharmacist
in the city.

116
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,600
He'll understand.

117
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,610
Thank you. Sincerely.

118
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,780
Great news, Uncle.

119
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,690
A little perdi-caca-something-um

120
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,900
and you'll be good as new.

121
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,200
Lucas, what are you doing?

122
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,330
You can't waste
your money on me.

123
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,920
I'm old and I've had
a good long run.

124
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,380
Spend it on a nice girl,
get settled down...

125
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,310
..so your old uncle
can die in peace.

126
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,770
Nobody's going to D-word.

127
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,720
I'll find the money
some...where.

128
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,150
Uncle, you'll be fine.
I've got you.

129
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,360
-I've got you!

130
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,420
Oh, madam,
it's your family mansion.

131
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,500
How...rustic.

132
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,840
Ugh, it's just
a revolting hovel.

133
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,060
A bunch of pathetic cowards!

134
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,470
All my plans are at risk

135
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:37,310
just because this primitive mob
is terrified by the forest.

136
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,520
-Move it, Frol!

137
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,190
Oh, ma'am. Right away.
Just a second.

138
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,650
Do me a favour and get
these peasant rags off me.

139
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,660
How can they wear
this hideous stuff?!

140
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,990
Ugh, I hate it.
Get rid of it right away.

141
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,870
What a terrible piece
of tasteless trash.

142
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,790
Stupid, uneducated,
superstitious mob.

143
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,210
-Frol!
-Oh, my God.

144
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,710
This is so old-fashioned.

145
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,550
Don't get me upset, Frol.

146
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,350
It's bad for my complexion.

147
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,510
Oh, sure, madam.

148
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,100
-Oh!

149
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,900
Clumsy idiots!

150
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,990
Inside this case is...

151
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,820
Just be careful with it.

152
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,660
Mm?

153
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,030
What is it?

154
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,630
Uh, about this job offer...

155
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,920
Oh, forget it.

156
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,330
Who's there?

157
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,790
Frol!

158
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,460
Oh, about THAT job offer?

159
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,920
Please come in.

160
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,590
Hi. My name's Lucas.

161
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,190
It says you'll pay well.

162
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,560
Hmm.

163
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,230
Hmm.

164
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,280
I will.

165
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,110
If you're up to it.

166
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,450
Uh, I am.

167
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,030
I can do any job.

168
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,290
Good.

169
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,290
Eric, Derek, you go with him.

170
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,750
So...what do I have to do?

171
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,040
Find me the tree with this leaf.

172
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,680
Uh... Huh!

173
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,090
In the forest
behind the Dark Mountain.

174
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,100
Hmm.

175
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,730
FOREST-DWELLER: What happened?

176
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,770
The guardian
is summoning everybody?

177
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,890
This hasn't happened
since I was a sapling.

178
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,700
-I'd rather take a nap.
-The guardian?!

179
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,650
Greetings upon the new spring,

180
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,910
my fellow forest-dwellers.

181
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,910
Is everyone here?

182
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,630
Mavka, did you wake
everybody up?

183
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
She's probably frolicking

184
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,760
through the crocuses
with Swampy again.

185
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,430
-I'm sorry I'm late, Guardian.

186
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,060
I was helping the lynx cub
get out of an old trap.

187
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,980
-How terrible!
-An old trap.

188
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,490
I thought they were
all removed after the battle?

189
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,150
Nymphs.

190
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,400
You are
the forest's armed forces.

191
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,190
Which one of you missed this?

192
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,910
Good job, Mavka.

193
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,200
You've embarrassed us
in front of the guardian.

194
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,180
Now, then,

195
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,140
listen, forest-dwellers.

196
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,180
The Supreme Spirits of Nature

197
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,570
whisper that dangerous times
approach.

198
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,230
Therefore, at midnight tonight,

199
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,400
in the heart of the forest,

200
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:31,540
the spirits shall choose
a new guardian.

201
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,700
Lesh, but what about you?

202
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,660
I have so little strength left.

203
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,670
The guardian's burden

204
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,670
has grown too heavy for me.

205
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,630
Lesh won't be
the guardian anymore?

206
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,640
Will the humans attack us again?

207
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,180
-Who else can protect us?
Hark.

208
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,260
Hush the sky conqueror
can become the guardian.

209
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,650
Guardian chatterbox?

210
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,690
Yeah, just what we need.

211
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,690
I heard that.

212
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,820
But really, anyone
can become the guardian.

213
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,910
You mean like even you?

214
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,660
No, no, no, Mavka.

215
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,780
You may be the sweet,
pure soul of the forest,

216
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:17,490
but for this job
you are just way too nice.

217
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,880
No, I'm not.

218
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,500
Ooh. I feel unwell.

219
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,090
Ondina, are you alright?

220
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,420
See? So gullible and nice!

221
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,040
Enough!

222
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,390
All will be decided at midnight

223
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,390
in the heart of the forest.

224
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,770
People say that
behind the Dark Mountain,

225
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,860
the water nymphs and tree
spirits can tickle you to death.

226
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,940
Uh, you're laughing and laughing

227
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,200
and then bleugh!

228
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,780
We don't believe in monsters
of the forest.

229
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,490
Where do we go from here?

230
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,990
I think through this way.

231
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,930
Uh...

232
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,650
Uh-huh.

233
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,770
I didn't think we came here
to hunt.

234
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,350
This isn't hunting.

235
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,280
This is fun.

236
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,240
-Yeah.

237
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,790
Impossible.

238
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,040
Today of all days.

239
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,760
It was an accident. I tripped.

240
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,140
I am extremely clumsy.

241
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,060
My childhood nickname was
Clumsy Lucas.

242
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,020
We'll make you
Clumsy Black-and-Blue-cus.

243
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,400
Mm-hm.

244
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,280
My brother thinks
you should go on by yourself.

245
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:26,710
If you find the tree,
mark it on the map.

246
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,580
OK.

247
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,290
I was gonna suggest that anyway.

248
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,350
I feel their fear.

249
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,200
Quiet down.

250
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,040
Everything is fine now.

251
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,590
What scared you so much?

252
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,170
Humans? Here?

253
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,050
I have to tell the nymphs.

254
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,510
Wait.

255
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,220
Come on, Swampy.

256
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,260
I'll deal
with the humans myself.

257
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:17,060
Let's show them how 'nice' I am.

258
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,130
Argh!

259
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,260
Where in the haunted heck
is this tree?

260
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,640
Believe in yourself, Lucas.

261
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,610
Let the music show you the way.

262
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,520
Whatever that means.

263
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,500
Ohh!

264
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,760
It's so beautiful.

265
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
Oh, thanks. I...

266
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,520
Uhh...

267
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,310
Argh!

268
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,400
-Argh!

269
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,480
Forest demon!

270
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,730
Argh!

271
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,700
Is the human dead?

272
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,300
Is this some sort
of human magic?

273
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,480
Mavka!

274
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,350
A lot of weird, whistly,
raspy sounds

275
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,850
coming from this exact area
and I...

276
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,860
-Uh, Hush.

277
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,320
You already learned
how to dismount the stork.

278
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,780
Nice.

279
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,900
I am on high alert.

280
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,110
Our forest has just been
incursion-ated by...

281
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,040
Argh! THE HUMANS!

282
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,210
I'll watch him.
You go get the nymphs.

283
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,330
Oh, no.

284
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,080
I say we can drive the human

285
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,830
out of the forest on our own.

286
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,920
So I would be Hush, the first
kicker-outer of humans?

287
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,800
Oh, I like that very much.

288
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,670
-Argh!

289
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,730
Uh... Argh! Evil spirits.

290
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,980
Keep back, I'm warning you.

291
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,560
I... I'm a...borscht belt
in combat polka.

292
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,990
Pathetic little human!

293
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,530
You violated
our sacred forest...

294
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,780
Huh?!

295
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,320
..and tried to harm
these noble bison.

296
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,360
No! Super no.

297
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,370
That was the bouncer brothers.

298
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,700
In fact, I saved
the bison from them!

299
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,500
What is this, then?

300
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,330
Oh. That's my flute.

301
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,040
I, uh, play my music on it...
with it.

302
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,210
'Music'?

303
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,130
And you were doing this

304
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,090
to try and magically
enchant me in some way?

305
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,300
No! Well, sure.

306
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,300
Music is kind of magic, but...

307
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,970
Wait, so you liked it, then?

308
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,430
You do not question me,
little human!

309
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,350
Why have you trespassed here?

310
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,430
A strange lady offered me a big
reward to find a special leaf.

311
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,440
Aha! You hear that? A reward!

312
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,860
I knew that all humans
were selfish and greedy!

313
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,780
-Why you little...

314
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,030
-Ouch.

315
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,290
You see this!
Human treachery!

316
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,420
Huh?

317
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,840
Wow!

318
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,140
You are the most amazingly
beautiful demon

319
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,600
I have ever seen.

320
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,390
Your eyes.

321
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,850
I am not a demon.

322
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:43,350
I am Mavka,
the soul of the forest.

323
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,690
Well, I'm Lucas.

324
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,730
The soul of...myself?

325
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,940
Look, I can explain.

326
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,990
I need that reward to buy
medicine for my uncle Leo.

327
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,910
No. I have been warned that
humans are skilful liars.

328
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,700
You have broken the law
of the forest and I expel you!

329
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,380
No expulsion necessary.
I'll leave myself.

330
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,920
Just let me find
this silly leaf first

331
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,590
or else my uncle...

332
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,630
..dies.

333
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,430
How awful. I'm so sorry.

334
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,640
-Whargh!

335
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,050
Hey there, little...

336
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,640
What are you?

337
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,970
This is Swampy,
the last of the kittyfrogs.

338
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,480
Awww!

339
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,310
It's so cute how much
he hates me.

340
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,480
-Oh!

341
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,400
You want something super yummy?

342
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,410
Had a feeling you'd like that.

343
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,370
You're very different
from the evil humans

344
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,780
in all the forest legends.

345
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,990
-Huh?

346
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,420
Huh?

347
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,500
Derek, hold my boomstick.

348
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,260
Derek?

349
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,590
Derek? Where are you?

350
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,940
I'll teach you,
you filthy human!

351
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,560
Hush, what are you doing?

352
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,810
Swampy, spit it out immediately!

353
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:56,230
This grotty fleshbag
is trying to poison you.

354
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,190
Hey! It's my mother's recipe.

355
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,450
Oh, Mommy
poisons folks too, huh?

356
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,860
Hush, stop!

357
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,700
Lucas, leave him alone.

358
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,710
-Huh?
-You gave it a name already?

359
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,160
Lucas. Stop it right now!

360
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,590
Well, he started it.
He has to leave.

361
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,130
I need the leaf.

362
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,420
Fine, here's a leaf. Now leave.

363
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,840
Not this one.

364
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,600
Are all humans this picky?

365
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,430
Lucas. It's not the leaves
you really need.

366
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,270
You need to heal your uncle

367
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,600
and I'll give you
the cure he needs.

368
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,890
Really?!

369
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,650
Oh, thank you. You are so nice.

370
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,030
Hey, hey, hey.

371
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,530
Do you really want
to break the law

372
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,070
to help a human on such a day?

373
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,780
You heard him.

374
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,620
He saved the bison,

375
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,160
and for some reason...
I believe him.

376
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,000
-Urgh!

377
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,370
After all,
the soul of the forest

378
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,340
must help all the living
creatures in the forest, right?

379
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,010
And Lucas is a living creature
who is in the forest.

380
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,760
-Huh?
-Therefore, I have to help him.

381
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,380
And you will help me help him.

382
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,840
Me?

383
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,270
No way! Never!

384
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,350
Never, never, never, never,
never, never, never!

385
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,310
-No!

386
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:22,060
When will I learn that I'm
incapable of saying no to you?

387
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:26,280
Don't worry, Hush. We'll make it
before the ceremony starts.

388
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,980
I'll give Lucas the cure
for his uncle and...

389
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:31,400
And then he'll leave
the forest forever.

390
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,360
I promise.

391
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,790
Hmm?

392
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,580
Come to me!

393
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:45,040
Don't be shy. Come closer.

394
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,880
Ahhh!

395
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,310
Huh?

396
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,610
Argh!

397
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,690
How did I...

398
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,360
Curses!

399
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,950
-Uh...

400
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,330
Oh.

401
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,280
Mm.

402
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,880
Huh?

403
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:34,040
Mavka, how can I thank you
for your help?

404
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,920
Just tell me and I'll do it
with pleasure.

405
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,350
Maybe you could play
your music for me?

406
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,100
Oh. Sure thing.

407
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,550
No, no, no, not now.

408
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,860
Nobody can know you're here.

409
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,810
No, let him play.

410
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,690
The nymphs will hide him
safely in the forest,

411
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,810
one piece here,
one piece there.

actually as terrible
as you've been taught.

447
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:52,090
We have a lot of nice things.

448
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,270
Like music. It's so lovely.

449
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,520
You must be the guardian
of music in your world.

450
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,390
Not yet.

451
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:03,810
But my dream is to fill
my whole life with music.

452
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,070
As soon as my uncle gets better,

453
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,240
my musician friends and I are
leaving for the big city.

454
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,570
"The big city".

455
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:14,400
What is the big city?

456
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,700
It's a place where everything
is made of bricks and stone

457
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,410
and there are as many buildings

458
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,870
as there are trees
in the forest...

459
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,700
Hurry up, hurry up. Move!

460
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,710
What are you doing?
Back off, shrubby.

461
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,010
Hush! Mavka!

462
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:32,510
Are you the ones
making all this noise?

463
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,420
Too late.

464
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,810
Nice knowing you, Mavka.

465
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:38,720
Up until today, anyway.

466
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,930
Lesh, how's it going?

467
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,270
Busier than I'd like.

468
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,190
Who is your guest?

469
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:50,110
Uh, I'm...Hush's...cousin.

470
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,900
Yes, dropped by
for a visit from overseas.

471
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,110
Right, Hush?

472
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,910
Uh-huh.

473
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,700
A very, very
many-times-removed cousin.

474
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,080
Shmucas is his name.

475
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:09,550
Ah! Welcome, friend Shmucas.

476
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:13,840
Come quickly.
The ceremony is about to begin.

477
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,180
Oh, great. What do we do now?

478
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,100
Do you realise how illegal
this is?

479
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,510
We just need to keep our
distance from the new guardian.

480
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:29,320
As soon as the ceremony is over,
I'll come up with something.

481
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,650
You look just like
your parents, madam.

482
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:43,780
Hm, much better now.

483
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,120
Yeah. Lovely portrait.

484
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,040
Totally...horridness.

485
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,130
Hmm?

486
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,250
Hmm. Did you find the tree?

487
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,680
So what stopped you?

488
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,890
Bunnies? Squirrels?
The forest demons?

489
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,690
Knuckleheads.

490
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:14,940
Totally useless. Oh!

491
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,150
Stop being such fools.

492
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,060
You are stupid idiots.

493
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,910
What am I paying you for?

494
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,950
And where is the boy?

495
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,530
Oh!

496
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,580
-Out of my way.

497
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,660
Oh!

498
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,070
Oh, damn!

499
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,990
I'm running out of time.

500
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,960
And where is this peasant loser?

501
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:41,940
Ohhh! Oh!

502
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,370
-Hey.

503
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,750
Shhh!

504
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,920
It is time.

505
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,220
Hmm!

506
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:15,480
Oh! That's the...

507
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,810
The Supreme Spirits of Nature,

508
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:22,060
I summon you.

509
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,480
The One Who Dwells in the Earth,

510
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,990
I call on you.

511
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,780
The One Who Moves the Waters,

512
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:40,120
I call on you.

513
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,200
The One Who Flies
with the Wind...

514
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,800
..the One Who Sits
on the Rock...

515
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,920
..I call on you.

516
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,890
Those who protect us,

517
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,180
those who help us,

518
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:06,560
those who dwell
at the Source of Life,

519
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:11,190
please choose the new guardian.

520
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,720
Mm.

521
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,930
Hmm?

522
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,230
The guardian is chosen.

523
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,570
Huh?

524
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,360
-Her?
-Me?

525
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,440
What's happening?
Is it good or bad?

526
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:02,830
Please close the knothole
on the front of your face.

527
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,240
Lesh, why me?

528
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,660
I can't possibly be
the guardian.

529
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,530
I have to tell you something.

530
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:12,670
The Supreme Spirits are wise,

531
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:17,710
and they know who is capable
of protecting our realm.

532
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,540
Now the Supreme Spirits

533
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,140
will bestow their powers
on the chosen one.

534
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,470
-Incredible.
-Perfect.

535
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,980
So how do we "keep our distance
from the new guardian" now?

536
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,730
Mavka, you are now granted

537
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:08,320
the powers of
the Supreme Spirits of Nature.

538
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,240
It is for you now

539
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,610
to always remember
that our enemy -

540
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:17,200
the humans - are out there.

541
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:20,870
Defend this fragile,
sacred place

542
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,040
with your very life.

543
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:27,500
Please welcome our new guardian

544
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:30,840
of the Source of Life
and the forest.

545
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:44,350
That was just...whoa!

546
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:47,350
Our little Mavka
is now the guardian.

547
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,570
I always knew this would happen.

548
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,490
There has got
to be some mistake.

549
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:57,190
Why did the spirits not choose
the strongest one?

550
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,040
With her as guardian,

551
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,750
our forest is more in danger
than ever.

552
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,870
Hey. Easy there, friend.

553
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:06,500
Who are you supposed to be?

554
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,080
Me? I am, uh, Hush's cousin.

555
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,090
You...

556
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,800
You stink like a human.

557
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,920
Yeah, he stepped in some human
on the way here.

558
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,180
Uh, Cousin Shmucas.

559
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,350
If he's a noise keeper,

560
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,720
I'm the new guardian
of the forest.

561
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,020
And we all know...

562
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,850
-..I'm not.

563
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,150
-Uh...oops.

564
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,570
Human?!

565
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:36,280
Run. Move your footsticks.

566
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,440
You treacherous human.
You have tricked me!

567
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,620
-Human?
-Oh, no, he's a human.

568
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,330
Don't let him get away!

569
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,090
Am I the only one here
who's completely confused?

570
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,840
Hush!

571
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,880
You've got a great deal
of explaining to do.

572
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,970
Argh!

573
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,730
-Huh?

574
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:13,110
Argh!

575
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,380
Argh!

576
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,640
Argh!

577
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:56,560
Argh!

578
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,780
-Mavka.
-Get on, quick.

579
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,160
The lynx will take you home.

580
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,200
Whoa! Sounds safe.

581
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,030
Nice...kitty.

582
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:13,410
Take this.

583
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:15,670
It will heal your uncle.

584
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,630
Thank you.

585
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:21,330
-Huh?

586
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:25,290
There's no time.
Go...and never return.

587
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,720
Death is the only thing
for a human to seek here.

588
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,140
-Go!
-Wait!

589
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,720
I promised I'd play for you.

590
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,930
Where is he? Where's the human?

591
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,560
He got away.

592
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,480
What? How did he...

593
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,400
You helped him?

594
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,650
You have the powers
of the guardian

595
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,660
at your disposal,
you could have -

596
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,030
no, you should have -
stopped him.

597
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:53,320
The guardian
doesn't need your help

598
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,280
deciding how and when
to use her powers, Ondina.

599
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,000
Mavka,

600
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,040
this human is no different
than all the others.

601
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,870
He will betray you.

602
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,330
And when he does,
we will all pay the price.

603
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,490
Hmm.

604
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:38,960
Frol!

605
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,120
Yes, madam?

606
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,540
There's something
about this boy Lucas

607
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,830
I don't trust.

608
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,220
Watch him.

609
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,840
I'm not so sure

610
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,840
he came back from the forest
empty-handed.

611
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,090
Me?!

612
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:57,260
Madam, I am a fashion tsar
in the making,

613
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,170
not a spy.

614
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:01,600
Oh, that's too bad.

615
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,810
If I get what I want,
I could establish you

616
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:07,390
as the number one fashion god...

617
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:09,350
..in the world.

618
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,070
With my own Soul of Frol
Manly Lace Boutique?

619
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,150
With a global chain

620
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,440
of whatever insane thing
you just said.

621
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,450
Then, if you need a spy,

622
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,950
why, Frol is your guy.

623
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:36,960
Ugh. Uh!

624
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:41,510
Silks, ribbons and laces
don't have to be disgraces.

625
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,430
That's the Soul of Frol.

626
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,680
No. This really happened to me.
Last night.

627
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,890
The forest is full of -
not demons - but creatures.

628
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,440
And they are
not fond of us at all.

629
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:01,980
Except Mavka. She is very nice.

630
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,620
Danger or no,
I have to go back to the forest

631
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,040
to Mavka, to thank her.

632
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:16,210
Lucas, look, if you've been at
the village fair all night long

633
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:20,340
and plan on going back,
you can just tell me.

634
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,210
Busted. You know me.

635
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,350
Party animal.

636
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:26,510
Best carnival ever.

637
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:39,360
Mmm!

638
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:50,280
So how is this,

639
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:54,240
uh, perdi-caca-something-um

640
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:56,040
supposed to work?

641
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:58,250
I have less than no idea.

642
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:03,130
-Huh?

643
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,850
Uncle?

644
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:16,610
Whoa!

645
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:18,980
Hah! And no pain.

646
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,770
I haven't stood this straight
in 20 years.

647
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:24,690
It's a miracle.

648
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:29,570
It is a miracle.

649
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,490
It's a miracle
of perdi-caca-something-um.

650
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:36,950
I've got so much energy.

651
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,580
Now I'll be Hercu-Leo.

652
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:41,630
Hey, let's take up curling.

653
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,960
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

654
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:26,960
Yeah, it's bit more
complicated now.

655
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,500
But, Swampy, think for yourself.

656
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,010
How can he play his beautiful
music without his flute?

657
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,880
We have to return this to Lucas.

658
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:46,480
What if something happens
in the forest while I'm gone?

659
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,650
What if nothing happens
while I'm here?

660
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,530
You're absolutely right.

661
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:55,650
I'm the guardian now.
I can't leave the forest.

662
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,860
Humans are enemies.

663
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,650
I somehow managed to live
without Lucas before.

664
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:02,500
Or his music.

665
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,080
Or his eyes.

666
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,460
Or his smile.

667
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,500
Or this feeling

668
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,620
that now lives right here.

669
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,770
Hmm. Mmm.

670
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:34,150
Madam! Madam! Where's Madam?

671
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:48,750
Madam
is probably upstairs.

672
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:50,500
-Gah!

673
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,010
Madam! Madam!

674
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,170
Madam, you were right!

675
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,600
Eugh!

676
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:07,350
That icky boy lied to you!

677
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:09,560
Here.

678
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:16,110
Oh.

679
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:18,650
Lucas was at the Source of Life.

680
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,860
The heart of the forest.

681
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:26,950
And I also found this.

682
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:31,160
Finally it will be mine!

683
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:35,450
But...but there is nothing
marked here!

684
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:39,210
Now think! Did Lucas
say anything about the tree?

685
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:40,590
No!

686
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,380
Nothing about the tree,

687
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,800
but he just said
he will go into the forest again

688
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,510
to see the nice forest.

689
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,060
The magma! Boy, what a fool.

690
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,260
It doesn't make sense.

691
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:54,060
The nice forest magma?

692
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,690
Yeah, that's what he said.

693
00:51:56,730 --> 00:52:00,360
He probably wants to keep
the source to himself.

694
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,770
-Frol.
-Yes, Madam?

695
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,270
-Keep an eye on this boy.

696
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,990
When he decides to go
to the forest,

697
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:10,990
we need to keep him company
by all means.

698
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,710
But on the other hand,
as the guardian,

699
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:26,460
shouldn't I learn as much
about our enemies as I can?

700
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:30,430
If Lucas isn't evil, maybe other
humans aren't evil either.

701
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:35,180
Oh, stop croaking about
the law of the forest!

702
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,390
Maybe it's time
for things to change

703
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,310
so that the forest-dwellers
and humans could live in peace.

704
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,440
Oh!

705
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,880
Uhh, no! I can't show up
looking like this.

706
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,000
-Hm!

707
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,290
Huh?

708
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,340
Gotta find something
a human would wear.

709
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,960
Hey, boy. I'm making a gift.

710
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:57,680
Yes, Dot,
Mavka is going to love me.

711
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,050
Uh, it! It.

712
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,270
And...done.

713
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,570
-Hey, where are the pies?!

714
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:21,070
Pie-demolisher!

715
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,000
-It's fine.

716
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,910
I'm not perfect either.

717
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,500
For instance, I'm about to
break my promise to Hush

718
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,120
and the forest law

719
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,460
in order to keep
my promise to Mavka.

720
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:39,800
Mavka, are you here?

721
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,010
Your hair! How are you here?

722
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:45,060
Aren't you happy to see me?

723
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,230
No. I mean, yes!

724
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:49,680
Heart-burstingly happy,

725
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:51,640
which is a thing I probably
shouldn't say out loud.

726
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:56,780
Oh, is this your nest?

727
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:01,110
I prefer
to think of it as a cave.

728
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,030
Is this for making music too?

729
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:08,750
-Uh, no.

730
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:13,250
Those are regular instruments,
not musical instruments.

731
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,960
I've come to return your flute.

732
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:17,260
It was broken, but I...

733
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,260
Here.

734
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,210
Thank you.

735
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:36,720
Now you can go to the stone
forest and follow your dream.

736
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:40,030
Just play for me one last time
and then I'll leave.

737
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,530
No. No, don't leave!

738
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:44,360
Uh, I have an idea.

739
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,610
I'll play even better music
for you.

740
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:49,450
There's a festival in town and
my band is playing. Let's go!

741
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:55,450
-Uh...
- Don't be afraid.

742
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,300
It'll be good
for guardian of the forest

743
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,000
to know more about us humans,
right?

744
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:00,880
Uh...

745
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:04,880
-You're gonna love it.

746
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:30,030
Huh?

747
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:34,830
Mavka, let's find you
an outfit that says,

748
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:37,370
"I am a non-alarming
local human."

749
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:39,090
What's wrong with this one?

750
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,460
Well, it kind of screams,

751
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,170
"Howdy, I'm a barely disguised
forest demon

752
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:45,750
"from behind the Dark Mountain."

753
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,840
Oh!

754
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:18,910
Oh.

755
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,460
-Oh!

756
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:27,290
-Hm?

757
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,300
-And this is my uncle Leo.
-Oh!

758
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:42,520
He's the one you saved
with your gift.

759
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:56,740
Hm?

760
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,160
What have you done?

761
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:04,750
Oh! Those are
my friends playing.

762
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:55,660
This music, the dancing -
how delightful!

763
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,470
But you still play better
than anybody else.

764
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:00,550
He was born that way!

765
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:03,510
So, Lucas,
Uncle Leo is recovered.

766
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:05,300
He looks better than you now.

767
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:08,310
Isn't it time to show
your talent to the big city?

768
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:11,020
Um, well...

769
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:14,810
Or has the music shown you
a different way?

770
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,820
A very beautiful way.

771
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,690
Well, your call, Romeo.

772
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,900
We're always happy
to have you with us.

773
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:25,030
Pack up. We gotta go.

774
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,370
Oh, that's right, it's late.
I must go too.

775
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:32,160
Thank you for the wonderful time
and for the gift.

776
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:36,000
Wait! I haven't fulfilled
my promise yet.

777
00:59:55,930 --> 01:00:00,720
-Look! A demon from the forest!

778
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,900
-She's glowing!
-Green hair!

779
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:09,190
An evil spirit from behind
the Dark Mountain!

780
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,700
What shall we do?

781
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,370
She's come to kill
our lovey ones

782
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:16,160
and destroy our food crops!

783
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,790
No! It's not true!

784
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,250
This lad is trying
to protect the demon.

785
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:22,840
She has bewitched him.

786
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,050
-She'll put a curse on us.

787
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:26,550
Get her!

788
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:29,300
No! She won't hurt anyone.

789
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:39,720
-Lucas!

790
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:41,190
No!

791
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:42,900
- Hm...
-Argh!

792
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:59,160
Let me go! Lucas!

793
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,410
What do we do?

794
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:04,040
-Burn her, right?
-No, they drown witches!

795
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:05,670
Let's do both!

796
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:09,130
My fellow villagers,
I was wrong.

797
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:13,340
The evil spirits of the forest
are very real.

798
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:18,180
And now I see that it was her
kind that burned up my father,

799
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:21,260
the goodly sawmill owner.

800
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,150
How dare she!

801
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:24,480
But fear not!

802
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,810
My eyes are open now

803
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:30,400
and I will find out what
the demons have in store for us,

804
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,940
be it plague...

805
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:33,410
-..drought...

806
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:37,820
-..famine, fire or flood!

807
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:40,820
And where the Source of Life is.

808
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:46,080
-Oh!

809
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:48,080
-What is this?!

810
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:50,920
-What's happening?
-Black magic!

811
01:01:57,510 --> 01:02:00,640
-Argh!

812
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:09,400
Don't let her get away!

813
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:23,280
-Lesh!

814
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:38,630
Where'd he go?
Is he gone?

815
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:42,050
All is lost!

816
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:46,840
My strong silks, my robust
ribbons, my manly laces,

817
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:50,270
the Soul of Frol - gone!

818
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:57,320
Oh!

819
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:02,530
It isn't over yet,
my whiny little pet.

820
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:09,150
My poor, dear,
terrified fellow villagers,

821
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:12,040
we underestimated
the demon's power

822
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,750
and the results were tragic.

823
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,260
But this is not the end.

824
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:20,880
They'll soon be back!

825
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:24,050
-Oh, no! What do we do?
-Oh, this is terrible!

826
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:27,800
There's only one way
to stop this evil.

827
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:29,560
Strike first!

828
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:39,530
Lesh,
how did you find me?

829
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:43,150
Hush told me everything.

830
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:46,150
I don't understand what's
happening. Those humans...

831
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:48,030
Calm down now.

832
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:51,450
Those humans obviously conspired

833
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,200
to lure you into a trap.

834
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:59,450
I love how no matter where you
look, you see goodness, Mavka,

835
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:04,380
but you have made
the same mistake I made once

836
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:07,260
in trusting a human.

837
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,130
Lucas would never do that.

838
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,560
I'm sure
he can explain everything.

839
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:21,110
-Mavka!?

840
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:35,830
Now, Lucas,

841
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:38,490
be a good boy of limited
intellect and integrity

842
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:42,240
and mark the Source of Life
on this crudely drawn map.

843
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,670
Never gonna happen, lady.

844
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:52,920
Somebody found a backbone!

845
01:04:52,970 --> 01:04:56,350
Let's see if we can't just
melt it like meringue.

846
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:58,430
Ooh, I'm peckish.

847
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:01,970
Oh, no!

848
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,410
Don't touch her!

849
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:15,280
The source...

850
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:17,370
-..or she dies.

851
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:28,590
Now let Mavka go!

852
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:31,790
Sure thing, ding-a-ling.

853
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:35,720
Oh, Lucas!
Smooch, smooch, swoon!

854
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,680
Oh, you saved me! You saved me!

855
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:42,600
You're so, so dumb.

856
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:46,440
No! Kylina, you won't
get away with this!

857
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,230
-Ah! Ah!

858
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:53,270
Really?
Guess I'll just stop, then.

859
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,910
Have a nice swim, sweetie!

860
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:10,000
So much water has flowed past
since that fateful day,

861
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:14,290
the time has come for me
to tell the full truth.

862
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:19,340
The battle
all those winters ago -

863
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:23,680
I've never told anyone
the reason why it happened.

864
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:30,230
The sawmill owner
came to me in tears.

865
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:34,150
He was begging me to save
his newborn daughter...

866
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,860
..and I believed in goodness
in him.

867
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,990
I gave this human

868
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:46,610
a drop from
the Source of Life itself.

869
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:49,920
Soon, he returned with...

870
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,080
..well, with an army of humans.

871
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:57,120
They wanted the Source of Life
for themselves.

872
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:03,340
So, I called for the Supreme
Spirit of the Underworld,

873
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:08,090
the One Who Sits in the Rock,
to give me the Spark of Rage.

874
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:14,100
And, may all those I love
forgive me,

875
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:16,640
he did.

876
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:23,240
Everything good in me
was replaced by sheer rage.

877
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,900
I burned and the world burned.

878
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:37,750
Humans and the forest alike.

879
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:43,630
Fire and hatred without end.

880
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,600
Have you seen Lucas?

881
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,180
Have you seen my boy, Lucas?

882
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,530
Oh!

883
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:05,030
Your boy's been taken by
the evil forest demons.

884
01:08:05,070 --> 01:08:08,440
-Huh?
-Stings, right?

885
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:13,070
But you can still save him
if you join us.

886
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:16,330
Take the weapon, old man.
I'm on a schedule here!

887
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:20,290
You stay here and make sure
nobody finds the boy...

888
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:23,840
..unless you were just dying
to be in the battle?

889
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:29,880
This is for our home!

890
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,840
And my youthful skin.

891
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:35,220
Now let's go
eradicate those demons

892
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:38,020
for the good of
all we hold dear!

893
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:42,100
-Yes!
-Yes! Death to the demons!

894
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:44,940
Start the forest killer!

895
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:19,260
Humans are preparing
to attack the forest.

896
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,760
Uh!

897
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:28,400
Hey! Somebody! Anybody! Hey!

898
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,290
Dot? Dot, is that you?

899
01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:50,630
Good boy!

900
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:53,340
Run! Find someone to help me!
Hurry!

901
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:06,930
So, that's it. War is here.

902
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,020
The sawmill owner's daughter...

903
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:13,020
I know what to do!

904
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:16,270
What? Decorate their axes
with flowers?

905
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,450
I know what we all need to do -
fight!

906
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:21,740
No! There's another way!

907
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:26,200
I am the guardian
and this is my call. Wait here.

908
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,790
-Don't look at me.

909
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:33,710
She is the guardian.

910
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:08,660
What's going on?

911
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,830
Whoa!

912
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:27,220
Please stop!

913
01:11:28,430 --> 01:11:29,510
Hm.

914
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:34,230
I might've frightened
the people at the fair,

915
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:37,140
but the forest means no harm
to humans.

916
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:40,890
We can live in peace
and even help each other.

917
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:43,240
"Help each other"?

918
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:46,450
A long time ago,
the forest gave a drop

919
01:11:46,490 --> 01:11:48,950
from the Source of Life
to the owner of the sawmill

920
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:51,780
so he could heal
his sick newborn daughter.

921
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:54,330
The forest saved you!

922
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:57,620
What? Nobody ever told me!

923
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:00,410
It is the truth.

924
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,300
The truth?

925
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:09,470
The truth is the sawmill owner
never had a daughter,

926
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:13,510
but he had a beautiful wife that
came up with a tragic story

927
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,350
about a little sick daughter.

928
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:19,140
My husband was obedient
but weak.

929
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:21,680
He only got me
the one lousy drop

930
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:25,190
that kept me young and fit
for all these years.

931
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,360
But how does this
make us enemies?

932
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,570
Oh, you'll never
understand this. Look at you!

933
01:12:30,610 --> 01:12:35,190
You're Nature's queen,
glowing and gorgeous forever!

934
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:38,290
You don't know nothing about
crow's-feet, turkey neck,

935
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:40,120
back fat.

936
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:43,830
You'll never get old
and saggy and shrivelled.

937
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,920
But I can give you
one more drop.

938
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,960
That is so nice of you,

939
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:54,590
but, see, if I get hold of
the entire Source of Life,

940
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,520
I will not only be young
and beautiful forever,

941
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,350
but it'll also make me

942
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:04,470
the richest,
most powerful woman ever.

943
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:07,440
But without the Source of Life,
the forest will die.

944
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,650
It's gonna die
one way or the other, honey,

945
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:11,940
so why not just
get out of my way?

946
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:13,820
Hm.

947
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:21,120
Not all humans are
as cruel and selfish as you are!

948
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:26,740
Oh, you're thinking about
that lad of yours? Lucas?

949
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,800
Huh?

950
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,880
Do you have any idea
where he is?

951
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:40,390
I...

952
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:43,180
I'll tell you another truth,
sister.

953
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:46,970
I paid Lucas very well
so he would find the source

954
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:49,150
and lure you into the village.

955
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:53,650
-Huh?
-He took his money and left.

956
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,030
To the city?

957
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,530
Exactly.

958
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:05,950
Oh.

959
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,170
And one more thing.

960
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:14,960
Lucas told me it was
almost too easy to fool you

961
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,380
because you're just so nice.

962
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:20,180
Oh.

963
01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:24,640
Now get out of my way

964
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:27,640
and take your
freaky woodland zoo with you!

965
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:40,730
Mavka! I knew we couldn't
trust that Shmucas!

966
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:43,700
I got it so wrong, Hush.

967
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:47,120
Humans really are all evil.
Lucas is...

968
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,410
Huh! Huh!

969
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:55,810
Who are you, friend?

970
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,390
You're saying
Shmucas didn't betray us?!

971
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:03,070
-Do you believe him?

972
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:06,860
Then I have an idea.

973
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:13,610
Mm! Frol Style!
Madam is going to love it!

974
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,710
Huh?

975
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,670
Well? Where's our hero?

976
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:31,130
Hm! Hm!

977
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:34,510
Go get Shmucas
and I'll deal with this one.

978
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,560
-Huh?

979
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,850
Hm!

980
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:41,680
Argh!

981
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:44,850
I will slice you into
robust little ribbons!

982
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:55,150
Dot?

983
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:12,340
Get back here,
you rotten cabbage!

984
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:19,390
Oh-ho-ho! You have
awakened the beast now!

985
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:21,930
Knock, knock! Anybody home?

986
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,320
Ooh!

987
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:05,970
-Hm.

988
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:52,100
Am I glad to see you!

989
01:18:54,190 --> 01:18:56,270
Ooh!

990
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:05,280
Oh-oh-oh!

991
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,620
Huh? Oh!

992
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:26,760
Hm.

993
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:58,750
So, that's where you're hiding,
you rotten old stump!

994
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:07,630
This is all my fault.

995
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:11,430
I have to stop this.

996
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:18,850
Supreme Spirit,

997
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:21,140
the One Who Sits in the Rock,

998
01:20:21,190 --> 01:20:23,060
I call on you!

999
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:27,770
No! Mavka, don't!

1000
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:40,080
You have called me, Guardian.

1001
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:47,870
I beg you, give me the strength
to answer my calling.

1002
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:51,130
I need the Spark of Rage
to protect the forest.

1003
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:54,880
The Spark of Rage has its price.

1004
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:57,770
The price paid
by the previous guardian

1005
01:20:57,810 --> 01:21:01,060
was his enormous strength.

1006
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:05,060
The rage burned him out
from the inside.

1007
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:07,350
And you,

1008
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,070
the Spark will cost you
your life.

1009
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:15,990
You shall enter the Nothingness
for eternity.

1010
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:20,500
I agree, for this
treacherous feeling here,

1011
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:23,580
now it brings only pain.

1012
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:26,910
As you wish, Guardian.

1013
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:34,090
Ondina was right.

1014
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:36,760
I was too nice.

1015
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:59,110
Whoa!

1016
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:08,540
I forgot to mention...

1017
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:11,590
I've got you now, weed-face!

1018
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:14,130
..I'm allergic to chainsaws!

1019
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:23,310
Hush, you alright?

1020
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:25,220
Oh, Shmucas!

1021
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:29,180
I'm fine. Got some yellow spots,
but, overall, fine.

1022
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:31,140
-Huh?

1023
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:40,860
This village has the worst aura!

1024
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:47,830
Hush, please,
I need to find Mavka!

1025
01:22:47,870 --> 01:22:50,700
What the hometown hurricane
is that?!

1026
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:54,210
It seems that IS Mavka.

1027
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,260
Oh!

1028
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:26,410
-Whoa!

1029
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:35,670
Mavka!

1030
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:39,670
It's me, Lucas! I'm here!

1031
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:43,880
Argh, I've got to get closer!

1032
01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:47,010
I might be able to help
with that.

1033
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:53,760
Thank you, dear cousin.

1034
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:58,350
Ha! They'll call me Hush,
who first befriended humans.

1035
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,850
Uh...uh... Whoa!

1036
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:07,070
-Whoa!

1037
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:09,700
Mavka! It's me!

1038
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:12,200
Please! You have to stop!

1039
01:24:14,370 --> 01:24:15,420
Aah!

1040
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:19,830
Whoa! Aah! Oh!

1041
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:24,710
-Oh!

1042
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:29,180
Where are you going?
You're gonna die!

1043
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:32,930
I don't care.
I have to save her.

1044
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:35,220
There's nothing you can do.

1045
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:38,730
She can no longer understand
your words. Do you copy?

1046
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:40,140
What did you say?

1047
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:44,440
I said she can't hear
your words! Run!

1048
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:47,350
Hush, you are a genius!

1049
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:51,900
Finally I can scratch
hearing that off my bucket list!

1050
01:24:51,950 --> 01:24:55,740
She can't hear my words,
but what if...

1051
01:25:26,310 --> 01:25:30,890
I got it! I got it!
They need our help.

1052
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:48,540
We should all do this together!

1053
01:26:40,050 --> 01:26:42,050
Mavka, it's me.

1054
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:47,310
Hear me, please!

1055
01:26:56,860 --> 01:27:01,690
Come back to me. Please!

1056
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:29,760
Is this what Nothingness
feels like?

1057
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:33,640
This is
the place of no phantom dreams,

1058
01:27:33,690 --> 01:27:37,520
where no songs are carried
by the wind.

1059
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:41,560
The fire of hate and rage
does not burn here.

1060
01:27:41,610 --> 01:27:44,650
Rage doesn't burn
in my heart anymore.

1061
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:50,780
I heard his voice and now
I know he never betrayed me.

1062
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:54,450
You have chosen
to spare the lives of the humans

1063
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:57,000
who have caused you
so much pain.

1064
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:00,710
But they also
gave me something

1065
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:03,130
I've never felt before.

1066
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,640
We have made the right choice

1067
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:11,760
making you the new guardian.

1068
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:15,050
You have bridged the gap
between the humans

1069
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:17,720
and the forest-dwellers,

1070
01:28:17,770 --> 01:28:21,650
but now you have to pay
the promised price

1071
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:26,230
and remain in
the Nothingness forever.

1072
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:28,280
For eternity.

1073
01:28:36,330 --> 01:28:37,830
No.

1074
01:28:37,870 --> 01:28:41,250
I'm alive
and I will live on forever

1075
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:45,540
because now my heart is full of
something that will never die.

1076
01:29:04,770 --> 01:29:08,810
Through the darkness,
I heard your music.

1077
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:12,780
It filled me here.

1078
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:16,570
Your music is the real magic.

1079
01:29:16,610 --> 01:29:18,740
No.

1080
01:29:18,790 --> 01:29:22,910
The only magic humans have
is love.

1081
01:30:19,770 --> 01:30:23,410
I think it's time to end our feud.

1082
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:24,110
